# grabgrub
Grabgrub MSYS22 WebApp project repository. Testing for deployment.

Feel free to look around the code, although a lot are redundant and could use some fixing. Do note, however that this is for the heroku app deployment, as some settings have changed to better suit it for deployment.

About the project:

GrabGrub is the project name, as such multiple apps and pages can be fitted inside this single project. Kiosk is currently the only working application, although it is very basic.

Happy coding!
